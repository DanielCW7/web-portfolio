                Since 2019, I've been teaching myself the ins and outs 
                of coding and web development. After much determination and patience, I landed my first job in Nashville 
                as a WordPress developer. Since then, Iâ€™ve been searching for ways to expand my learning 
                so that one day work at a big tech company.
